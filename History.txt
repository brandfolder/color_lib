== ColorLib 1.4.1 / 2010.02.03
* Imported to github.
* Converted to Hoe 2.5 spec format.

== ColorLib 1.4.0 / 2007.02.11
* Merged Austin Ziegler's color-tools library (previously part of the Ruby
  PDF Tools project) with Matt Lyon's color library.
  - The HSL implementation from the ColorLib class has been merged into
    ColorLib::HSL. ColorLib is a module the way it was for color-tools.
  - A thin veneer has been written to allow ColorLib::new to return a ColorLib::HSL
    instance; ColorLib::HSL supports as many methods as possible that were
    previously supported by the ColorLib class.
  - Values that were previously rounded by ColorLib are no longer rounded;
    fractional values matter.
* Converted to hoe for project management.
* Moved to the next step of deprecating ColorLib::Name values; printing a
  warning for each use (see the history for color-tools 1.3.0).
* Print a warning on the access of either VERSION or COLOR_TOOLS_VERSION; the
  version constant is now COLOR_VERSION.
* Added humanized versions of accessors (e.g., CMYK colours now have both #cyan
  and #c to access the cyan component of the colour; #cyan provides the value
  as a percentage).
* Added CSS3 formatters for RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA outputs. Note that the
  ColorLib library does not yet have a way of setting alpha opacity, so the
  output for RGBA and HSLA are at full alpha opacity (1.0). The values are
  output with two decimal places.
* Applied a patch to provide simple arithmetic colour addition and subtraction
  to ColorLib::GrayScale and ColorLib::RGB. The patch was contributed by Jeremy
  Hinegardner <jeremy@hinegardner.org>. This patch also provides the ability to
  return the maximum RGB value as a grayscale colour.
* Fixed two problems reported by Jean Krohn <jb.krohn@free.fr> against
  color-tools relating to RGB-to-HSL and HSL-to-RGB conversion. (ColorLib and
  color-tools use the same formulas, but the ordering of the calculations is
  slightly different with ColorLib and did not suffer from this problem;
  color-tools was more sensitive to floating-point values and precision
  errors.)
* Fixed an issue with HSL/RGB conversions reported by Adam Johnson
  <adam.sven.johnson@gmail.com>.
* Added an Adobe ColorLib swatch (Photoshop) palette reader,
  ColorLib::Palette::AdobeColorLib (for .aco files only).

== ColorLib 0.1.0 / 2006.08.05
* Added HSL (degree, percent, percent) interface.
* Removed RGB instance variable; color is managed internally as HSL floating
  point.
* Tests!

== color-tools 1.3.0
* Added new metallic colours suggested by Jim Freeze <jfn@freeze.org>. These
  are in the namespace ColorLib::Metallic.
* Colours that were defined in the ColorLib namespace (e.g., ColorLib::Red,
  ColorLib::AliceBlue) are now defined in ColorLib::RGB (e.g., ColorLib::RGB::Red,
  ColorLib::RGB::AliceBlue). They are added back to the ColorLib namespace on the
  first use of the old colours and a warning is printed. In version 1.4, this
  warning will be printed on every use of the old colours. In version 1.5,
  the backwards compatible support for colours like ColorLib::Red will be
  removed completely.
* Added the ColorLib::CSS module, color/css or ColorLib::CSS that provides a name
  lookup of ColorLib::RGB-namespaced constants with ColorLib::CSS[name]. Most of
  these colours (which are mirrored from the ColorLib::RGB default colours) are
  only "officially" recognised under the CSS3 colour module or SVG.
* Added the ColorLib::HSL colour space and some helper utilities to ColorLib::RGB
  for colour manipulation using the HSL value.
* Controlled internal value replacement to be between 0 and 1 for all
  colours.
* Updated ColorLib::Palette::Gimp to more meaningfully deal with duplicate named
  colours. Named colours now return an array of colours.
* Indicated the plans for some methods and constants out to color-tools 2.0.
* Added unit tests and fixed a number of hidden bugs because of them.

== color-tools 1.2.0
* Changed installer from a custom-written install.rb to setup.rb
  3.3.1-modified.
* Added ColorLib::GreyScale (or ColorLib::GrayScale).
* Added ColorLib::YIQ. This colour definition is incomplete; it does not have
  conversions from YIQ to other colour spaces.

== color-tools 1.1.0
* Added color/palette/gimp to support the reading and use of GIMP color
  palettes.

== color-tools 1.0.0
* Initial release.
